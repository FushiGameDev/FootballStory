 ### [ðŸŽ¦ Gameplay]()  
 
<h2>Description</h2>

This was my first unofficial, fully completed game. It tells a short story about a soccer player. The main setting is a simple stadium, where the protagonist narrates his journey. As the story progresses, new mechanics are introduced to symbolize the player's development.

<h3> Story </h3>
Floating spheres represent people the protagonist encounters throughout his life. In his youth, he doesn't realize how important these "filled stadiums" are, but by the end of the game, this theme becomes more apparent. In the final scene, the player, now enclosed on the field, faces a choice that is made by scoring a goal in one of two nets. The game concludes with a final twist, and for those curious, expanding the story reveals spoilers.

  <summary><b>Endings</b> </summary>

<h4><b>Sorry</b></h4>

In this scenario, where the player chooses to apologize, the previously encountered spheres light up again, illuminating the now closed-off world of the protagonist. The game then shuts down, symbolizing the end of the protagonistâ€™s isolation on his metaphorical field.

<h4><b>Shot</b></h4>

In the alternative choice, where the player chooses to shoot, the protagonist is left alone with an illuminated ball, representing what is most important to him. In this case, the game doesn't end automatically; instead, the protagonist remains with what matters most to him.

Although one ending leads to a sudden conclusion of the story, and the other leaves the player wandering in the dark, I believe neither ending is better than the other. Both are beautiful in their own way. At least that's what I tried to somehow convey.

<h2> General thoughts: </h2>

<h3> ${\textsf{\color{GREEN}What I'm proud of:}}$ </h3>

ðŸŸ¢ Cool story for a first concept.  
ðŸŸ¢ Mixing story with game mechanics.  
ðŸŸ¢ Elements of the world highlight a key theme.  
ðŸŸ¢ Interaction with the ball.  
ðŸŸ¢ Lights effect are simple but they did the job at the end.  

<h3> ${\textsf{\color{RED}What I'm not satisfied with:}}$ </h3>

ðŸ”´ Shooting ball is sometimes buggy (prob. cuz of bad scaling vectors of force)  
ðŸ”´ Graphics...   
ðŸ”´ And 3D models...   
ðŸ”´ Story told only by subtitles.  
ðŸ”´ Subtitle system.  

<h3> ${\textsf{\color{BLUE}What I learned:}}$  </h3>

ðŸ”µ Using light.  
ðŸ”µ UI.  
ðŸ”µ Unity 3D Physics.  
ðŸ”µ Making 3d models via unity probuilder.  
ðŸ”µ The subtitle system should be more automated, rather than relying solely on coroutines for each sentence. This approach also makes debugging more difficult.  
ðŸ”µ Particle effects.
